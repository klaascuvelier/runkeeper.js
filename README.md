Runkeeper.js
============

List trips in a Runkeeper database file, and export them to GPX format.


About
-----
I initially wrote this NodeJS script because I couldn't sync RunkeeperÂ® trips to runkeeper.com anymore (IOS6 beta 1 and beta 2).
The script can list all the trips in a Runkeeper database file, and can export them in GPX format.
You can either print the output to the console or write it in a file.

USAGE
-----

```node ./runkeeper.js <input-file> [action] [extra argument(s)] [output-file]```

Possible actions:

```list``` shows list with all trips in the input file

```export <trip-id>``` export a specific trip

RUNKEEPER DATABASE FILE FROM IOS
--------------------------------
To get the database file from your IOS device, you'll have to *explore* you're device.
The file is situated Apps/Runkeeper/documents/ and is called RunKeeper.sqlite
Export that file to your local filesystem and use it as input file for the script
